Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Connection.

0.13
      - Renamed `do()` to `runup()` and `txn_do()` to `txn_runup()`. The old
        methods issue a warning when called, and be removed in two releases.
      - Added `run()` and `txn_run()`. They're like `runup()` and
        `txn_runup()` except that they ping before executing their code ref
        arguments.
      - Fixed the GitHub links for realz.
      - Updated minimum required Test::More to 0.88 so that testing classes
        with `isa_ok()` will work as expected. Thanks to mlawren for the spot.
      - Fixed bug passing arguments on retry in `txn_runup()`. Thanks to
        [Mark Lawrence](http://github.com/mlawren) for the pull request.
      - The database handle is now available in `$_` from within `run()`,
        `txn_run()`, `runup()`, `txn_runup()`, and `svp_do()`, in addition to
        being passed in as the first argument.
      - Fixed a bug in `txn_runup()` where it would fail to notify other
        blocks that it was running the block when the user started a
        transaction.
      - Changed `dbh()` so that it does not call `ping()` when it is called
        from within a `run()`, `txn_run()`, `runup()`, `txn_runup()`, or
        `svp_do()` block.
      - Made the docs with regard to the re-execution of a code block in
        `runup()` more accurate, thanks to Tim Bunce.
      - Fetching a cached database handle now always checks its `Active`
        attribute as well as different process and thread IDs. The only thing
        not always done is `ping`ing the database.

      - Fixed the GitHub links, which were still using the old name.
      - Removed `use feature` and `use utf8` from `t/pod-coverage.t` -- those
        were pastos from another project.
      - Removed `use DBD::SQLite` from DBix::Connector::Driver::SQLite. It
        will already have been loaded by the time that code loads.

      - Filled in the important details in the README.
      - Changed name from DBIx::Connection to DBIx::Connector, as there is
        already a module called DBIx::Connection on the CPAN.

0.10  2009-10-05T21:16:03
      - Initial version, with code borrowed from DBIx::Class, Apache::DBI,
        Catalyst::Model::DBI, and various other locales.
