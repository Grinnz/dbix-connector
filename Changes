Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Connection.

0.13
      - Added `run()`, `ping_run()`, and `fixup_run()` as replacements for
        `do()`. The latter will issue a warning when called, and be removed in
        two releases.
      - Added `txn_run()`, `txn_ping_run()`, and `txn_fixup_run()` as
        replacements for `txn_do()`. The latter will issue a warning when
        called, and be removed in two releases.
      - Added `svp_run()`, `svp_ping_run()`, and `svp_fixup_run()` as
        replacements for `svp_do()`. The latter will issue a warning when
        called, and be removed in two releases.
      - Fixed the GitHub links for realz.
      - Updated minimum required Test::More to 0.88 so that testing classes
        with `isa_ok()` will work as expected. Thanks to mlawren for the spot.
      - Fixed bug passing arguments on retry in `txn_fixup_run()`. Thanks to
        [Mark Lawrence](http://github.com/mlawren) for the pull request.
      - Fixed a bug in `txn_fixup_run()` where it would fail to notify other
        blocks that it was running the block when the user started a
        transaction.
      - Changed `dbh()` so that it does not call `ping()` when it is called
        from within a code reference passed to a `run*()` method.
      - Made the docs with regard to the re-execution of a code reference
        passed to `fixup_run()` more accurate, thanks to Tim Bunce.
      - Fetching a cached database handle now always checks its `Active`
        attribute as well as different process and thread IDs. The only thing
        not always done is `ping`ing the database.

      - Fixed the GitHub links, which were still using the old name.
      - Removed `use feature` and `use utf8` from `t/pod-coverage.t` -- those
        were pastos from another project.
      - Removed `use DBD::SQLite` from DBix::Connector::Driver::SQLite. It
        will already have been loaded by the time that code loads.

      - Filled in the important details in the README.
      - Changed name from DBIx::Connection to DBIx::Connector, as there is
        already a module called DBIx::Connection on the CPAN.

0.10  2009-10-05T21:16:03
      - Initial version, with code borrowed from DBIx::Class, Apache::DBI,
        Catalyst::Model::DBI, and various other locales.
