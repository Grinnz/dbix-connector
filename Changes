Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Connection.

0.13
      - Fixed the GitHub links for realz.
      - Updated minimum required Test::More to 0.88 so that testing classes
        with `isa_ok()` will work as expected. Thanks to mlawren for the spot.
      - Fixed bug passing arguments on retry in `txn_do()`. Thanks to
        [mlawren](http://github.com/mlawren) for the pull request.
      - The database handle is now available in `$_` from within `do()`,
        `txn_do()`, and `svp_do()`, in addition to being passed in as the
        first argument.

      - Fixed the GitHub links, which were still using the old name.
      - Removed `use feature` and `use utf8` from `t/pod-coverage.t` -- those
        were pastos from another project.
      - Removed `use DBD::SQLite` from DBix::Connector::Driver::SQLite. It
        will already have been loaded by the time that code loads.

      - Filled in the important details in the README.
      - Changed name from DBIx::Connection to DBIx::Connector, as there is
        already a module called DBIx::Connection on the CPAN.

      - Initial version, with code borrowed from DBIx::Class, Apache::DBI,
        Catalyst::Model::DBI, and various other locales.
